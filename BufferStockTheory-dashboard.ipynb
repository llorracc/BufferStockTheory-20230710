Explore what happens to the consumption function as you move the parameters as far as you can toward the perfect foresight model and the time preference factor up toward 1 (warning: the model takes longer to solve if the RIC is close to failing; be patient).  What would you expect to see if the upper boundary of the figure were extended far enough?  \n",

Uncertainty has powerful effects!"
