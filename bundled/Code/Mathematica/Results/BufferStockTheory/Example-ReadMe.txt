Brief instructions:

For an example of how to use the code interactively, open the "Example.nb" notebook.

After excecuting the contents of the first cell of that notebook (select it and hit shift-return), you will have loaded the model solution routines.

The second cell sets the parameters to the baseline values, constructs the grids for the state variables, sets up the last period, solves the model, and plots the consumption function.

The next cell resets parameters to their baseline values, then sets the growth factor to a lower value, and solves the model again under the new parameter values.

The final cell plots the two consumption functions, showing the effects of slower income growth.
