./CoreCode contains general purpose algorithms for solving and simulating a buffer stock
model of the kind described in the paper "Theoretical Foundations of Buffer Stock Saving"

./Results contains folders that, using the general-purpose code in ./CoreCode, produce specific 
results for a specific paper.  

./Results/BufferStockTheory/doAll.nb 

is the notebook that produces all the figures and other results in the "Theoretical Foundations" paper.

Scattered through the code are cryptic comments like "eq:MaxMPCInv".
These refer to the equation label in the LaTeX source code for what is
going on in the Mathematica code on the commented line.
