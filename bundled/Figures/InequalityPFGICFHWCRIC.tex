  \footnotesize{The $\neq$ signals that the arrows reflect inequality relationships.  Arrows reflect the direction of the relationship; an arrowhead points to the larger of the two quantities being compared.  For example, the topmost arrow, pointing from $\APFac$ to $\PermGroFac$, indicates that $\PermGroFac > \APFac$.}
